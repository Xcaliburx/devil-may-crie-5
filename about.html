                  <p>Devil May Cry 5 is a 2019 action-adventure game developed and published by Capcom. 
                      It is the sixth installment overall and the fifth mainline installment in the Devil May Cry series. 
                      Capcom released it for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 8 March 2019. 
                      The game takes place five years after Devil May Cry 4 and follows a trio of warriors with demonic 
                      powers, the returning Dante, Nero, and a new protagonist named V, as they attempt to stop the 
                      Demon King Urizen from destroying the human world. Across their journey in Red Grave City, 
                      the player can use these characters in different missions. Each of them has their own way of 
                      fighting and becoming stronger. As this happens, the mystery behind V is revealed, along with 
                      his connection with Urizen.</p>

                  <p>On 16 May, devil hunter Nero hunts a demon named Urizen after a dying man takes his demonic arm 
                      and the sword Yamato. Traveling to Red Grave City, he finds a demonic tree called Qliphoth planted 
                      in the city, killing people for their blood. Dante's group confronts Urizen but, empowered by the 
                      Qliphoth, the new demon king incapacitates them and overpowers Nero when he intervenes. Dante stops 
                      Urizen from capturing Nero but is defeated and ejected from the Qliphoth with his sword Rebellion 
                      shattered. His allies Lady and Trish are captured to be used as demon-cores while a client of Dante, 
                      V, convinces the weakened Nero to escape. On 15 June, Nero returns to Red Grave outfitted 
                      with the "Devil Breaker" prosthetic arm, made by his friend and gunsmith, Nico. 
                      Nero meets up with V, who is seeking Qliphoth for its fruit—born of condensed human blood—which 
                      makes whoever consumes it the king of the Underworld. As the pair destroy the Qliphoth's roots 
                      while searching for Dante, Nero rescues Lady while V splits off to discover the Devil Sword 
                      Sparda - along with a hibernating Dante, whose presence was hidden by the sword</p>
